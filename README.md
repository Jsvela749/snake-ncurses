# Snake on Ncurses

This is my repo for a game I programmed in C during my third semester on Computer's Science Bachelor's Degree.

It is fully programmed on C language for the Linux platform and uses the NCurses library to draw into a terminal the full game.

If someone is motivated to upgrade or add features to the game, you surely can do!
